## Class Norms
I would like to make explicit some norms that I hope are wholly embraced in the classroom.
  - Treat our time in the classroom as you would meeting with the executive team or board of directors of your company. This means listening to and respecting the perspectives of your peers. It also means speaking up and disagreeing when you have a different opinion.
  - Arrive to class on time and prepared to contribute.
  - Participating in class (both speaking and listening to your colleagues) is a critical component of this module.
  - *Do not* wait until you have *the perfect* comment to raise your hand and speak in class.
  - Take risks with your ideas.
  - Speak in class if you have a question. If you have a question, it's very likely that your peers do as well.
  - Embrace failure and the iterative nature of learning and discovery.

## Honor Code
By taking this module, you are agreeing to maintain the highest level of academic and professional integrity. For your work, this means citing sources wherever appropriate and producing work that is your own. Cheating, plagiarizing, or misrepresenting one's work are a violation of our classroom's aspirational norms and the program's code of conduct.

## Software
Because we focus on underlying principles, I do not require the use of any specific software or tools. For required work, it is the student's responsibility to understand the problem, identify a path towards solution, and implement that path how he or she sees fit.

Having said that, I provide supplemental resources for students to study the tools and implementation of the approaches we discuss in class. Those resources will refer to the following software:

- [MS Excel](https://products.office.com/en-us/excel) and [Numbers](https://www.apple.com/numbers/). Spreadsheets.
- [Tableau](http://www.tableau.com/). Data visualization tool.
- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com). Integrated development environment (IDE) for the statistical programming language, [R](https://cran.r-project.org).

## Datasets
Data is everywhere online. If you want to explore data during or after our time together, I have assembled an list of [data sources](https://github.com/bus-strat-analytics/data-sources) you can use as an initial point for your search.

## Recommended Books
While no books are required for this class, I recommend a selection of the following books to complement what you will see during the term.

  - Diez, D. M., C. D. Barr, and M. Cetinkaya-Rundel (2015). [OpenIntro Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php). OpenIntro.
  - Few, S. (2012). Show Me The Numbers: Designing Tables and Graphs to Enlighten. Burlingame, CA: Analytics Press.
  - Gonick, L. and W. Smith (2000). Cartoon Guide to Statistics. New York: HarperPerennial. (Sounds like a silly book, but it is quite good)
  - Grant, R. M. (2016). Contemporary Strategy Analysis. United Kingdom: John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

## Assessment
Assessment is based on an individual assignment (60%) and a team project (40%).

Teams will consist of four to five students (no more than five) and will work on devising a business plan that combines the strategy-related topics we cover in class with the analytics topics.

## Schedule
We will break down each day into six blocks of approximately 70 minutes and class time will be divided between interactive lectures and labs/investigations. Below is the schedule, listing topics we will cover.
